# Path Finding Visualizer

This project is a web application that visualizes various path-finding algorithms, such as Dijkstra's algorithm, Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Depth-First Search (DFS). It allows users to create and modify a grid, set start and end nodes, add walls, and then visualize how the selected algorithm finds the shortest path between the start and end nodes.

## Live Demo

You can see the project in action at [pathfinding-algorithm-visualizer](https://visualizer-project.netlify.app/).

## Features

- Interactive grid creation and modification
- Select start and end nodes by clicking on the grid
- Add or remove walls by clicking and dragging on the grid
- Choose from multiple path-finding algorithms (Dijkstra's, BFS, DFS)
- Visualize the algorithm step-by-step, including visited nodes and the shortest path
- Real-time performance metrics (visited nodes, shortest path nodes, and time taken)
- Responsive design for various screen sizes

## Technologies Used

- React.js
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
